			<p>Iâ€™m a designer, developer, mostly focusing on web things but open-minded to mobile development and hardware technologies as well. One day it would be great if I could learn to bake all kinds of pastry too ðŸ˜…</p>

			<p>I have more than 12 years of experience in web development. I started as an ActionScript developer, then learned the basics of PHP, HTML, JS, and some server configuration stuff as well. With this knowledge stack, I could build most of the things I wanted to.</p>

			<p>In the past 5 years I had the opportunity to grow my management skills, as the head of development team at the biggest social media agency in Hungary.</p>

			<p>To fulfill my dreams about the bakery stuff (kidding), in January 2019 I left my 9 to 5 job and jumped back on the dev train. Now I build products to solve my own (and hopefully othersâ€™) problems.</p>

				) but in most cases Iâ€™m on a read only mode. Iâ€™ll try to share my progress more often there ðŸ¤ž, so if you are interested, feel free to follow me. For more detailed information about my thoughts, ideas and the projects Iâ€™m working on you can take a look at my blog posts.
