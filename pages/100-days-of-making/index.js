			<h3>What is this all about?</h3>
			<p>
				I built a few{" "}
				<Link href="/projects">
					<a>projects</a>
				</Link>{" "}
				in the past. Some of them were successful, some not. But in most cases I stopped working on them after a few months. That&apos;s probably because I have so many ideas I&apos;d like to work on, that after I finished one I felt the need to jump on the next one. Especially if the one I worked on failed. But it&apos;s hard to tell if something really failed if you spent only a month working on it, with almost zero effort on distribution. I did that in the past with almost all of my projects.
			</p>
			<p>This time, I&apos;d like to take a different approach. For 100 days, I&apos;ll work on only one product. In the beginning I&apos;ll spend 3 days writing code and 2 days on marketing and distribution. Once the mvp is done, I&apos;ll switch that to 2 days on development, 3 on customer acquisition and marketing.</p>
			<p>I&apos;m not going to do this full time, but a few hours every business day. This was also a problem for me in the past. The pace at the beginning was quite fast but slowed down after a few weeks. Mainly because I ran out of energy for keeping too many things on my plate. </p>
			<p>Why 100 days? Well, they say that if you do something for 100 days, it&apos;ll become a habit. Also because a hundred days seems like a reasonable amount of time to see if something is going to work or not. And I need some kind of virtual deadline. So, here we go ðŸš€</p>
